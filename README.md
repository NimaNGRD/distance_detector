This repository includes a simple distance measurement demo project using readings from IntelÂ® RealSenseâ„¢ Depth Camera D435.

These scripts can also be used with other RealSense depth camera models, like D415, D435i, and D455.

### Requirements
* Python 3
* OpenCV
* NumPy
* PyRealSense

These scripts have been tested on:

Software: Jetpack 4.6, Python 3.6.9, OpenCV 4.5.1, librealsense 2.35.2
